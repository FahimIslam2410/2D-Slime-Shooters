# 2D-Slime-Shooters

This repository contains a 2D survival game developed using the GDQuest video tutorial as a foundation. The tutorial can be found [here](https://youtu.be/GwCiGixlqiU?si=Uaq3iUEdZsbVyG6G). I challenged myself to complete as much as possible within a 4-hour timeframe, with only 2 hours spent following the tutorial. Prior to this project, I worked on smaller Godot projects to gain a basic understanding, and this game demonstrates how those individual projects can come together to create a semi-fleshed-out game.

## Game Overview:

The game is a 2D survival game where slimes attack the player. A gun rotates around the player and automatically shoots any enemies that come within proximity. Players can control the character using either the WASD keys or arrow keys. The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible.

**Highest Score:**
- My highest score was 230 mobs killed and 353 mobs spawned.

3. **Custom Powerup:**
   - Implemented a custom powerup that increases the gun's shooting speed for a limited duration.
   - The powerup spawns at random locations in the game.

3. **Additional Custom Powerups:**
   - Explore and implement more custom powerups to diversify gameplay.

4. **Powerup Expiry Time:**
   - Add an expiry time to the powerups, providing a time limit for their effects.

5. **Mob Variety:**
   - Add more types of mobs.
   - Introduce mobs with different abilities, such as faster movement or increased health.
